# Beyond the Stats: Analyzing the Effect of Fatigue on Pitchers in Extra Innings
**Submission for the 2024 SMT Data Challenge - Undergraduate Division**

Traditional baseball scouting often relies on game statistics, which fail to capture
nuanced factors influencing player performance, especially fatigue and endurance.
Noticeably, there is a lack of fatigue analysis of players in the farm systems. This
can lead to suboptimal training, management, and rehab strategies for developing
pitchers. Therefore, we propose that conducting such an analysis will provide a
clearer understanding of the factors distinguishing each class, particularly between
High-A and Double-A. Building on existing studies of pitcher fatigue in MLB, this
paper uses cluster and regression analysis to explore the relationship between fatigue
and performance in extra innings. Insights from this analysis, as well as a UI tool
we developed in this project, augment the current approach to player assessment
and assist coaches in making more informed decisions regarding pitcher usage and
development, particularly during the crucial Double-A jump.
